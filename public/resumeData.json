    "bio": "Hello! I'm an undergraduate at Duke studying Computer Science. I am fascinated by all kinds of technology, especially software! I will take any and every opportunity that I can to learn, be it reading car manuals cover to cover or listening to others' life stories. In my free time I love to go on bike rides, read about the newest cars to hit the streets and build computers. My goal as a software engineer is to produce reliable and scalable code but more importantly, work towards becoming a better developer and team member every day.",
