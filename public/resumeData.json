    "bio": "Hello! I'm an undergraduate at Duke University studying Computer Science. I am fascinated by all kinds of technology, especially software! I will take any and every opportunity that I can to learn, be it reading car manuals cover to cover or watching tech product reviews. In my free time I love going on bike rides, window shopping for shoes and building computers. My goal as a software engineer is to produce performant and responsive products but more importantly, work towards becoming a better developer and team member every day.",
